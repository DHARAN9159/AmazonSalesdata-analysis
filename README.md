The task involves analyzing Amazon sales data with a focus on efficiency. First, the data cleaning process includes handling missing values, standardizing entries in columns like Status, removing duplicates, and ensuring that numerical columns, such as Amount, are properly formatted. After cleaning, the data is transformed by calculating Total Revenue (Amount * Qty) and grouping it by month to identify any sales trends over time.

Next, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted. Key metrics such as the average order value, total quantity sold, and the distribution of order statuses are calculated. This allows for an understanding of sales performance and common order statuses (e.g., Shipped, Pending). Data visualizations are used to highlight insights, including a line chart to show monthly sales trends, a bar chart to display the distribution of order statuses, and a stacked bar chart to compare sales performance across different fulfillment methods.

The analysis reveals that sales are highest in the fourth quarter, indicating strong seasonality, particularly during the holiday season. It also highlights that Amazon Fulfillment has a lower percentage of “Pending” orders compared to Seller Fulfillment, suggesting that Amazon’s fulfillment process is more efficient.

Based on these insights, recommendations include increasing the use of Amazon Fulfillment to reduce order delays and better preparing for Q4 by stocking up earlier to meet seasonal demand. Additionally, further monitoring of fulfillment status across channels may help improve operational efficiency.

This analysis provides actionable insights to improve sales and operational strategies, ensuring better alignment with demand patterns and fulfillment efficiency....
